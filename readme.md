6. Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
   .In Statically typed Languages, type checking occurs at compile time. At compile time, source code in a specific programming language is converted to a machine-readable format. This means that before source code is compiled, the type associated with each and every single variable must be known.Examples of languages that belongs to this category are Java, Haskell, C, C++, C#, Scala, Kotlin, Fortran, Go, Pascal, and Swift.

   .In dynamically typed languages, type checking takes place at runtime or execution time. This means that variables are checked against types only when the program is executing. Some examples of programming languages that belong to this category are Python, JavaScript, Lisp, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Lua, and Tcl.

7. Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined&nbsp;
   .Null: This is an intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript.
   .Undefined: This means the value does not exist in the compliler.or the variable is declared, but no value has been assigned. it is the global object.
